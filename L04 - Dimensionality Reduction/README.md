# Exercise - Dimensionality Reduction

Use the [mnist_all](../Datasets/mnist_all.mat) dataset: A training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples; each having a size of 28 x 28 = 784 (concatenating the pixels).
Do exercise:

1. from the 10-class database, choose three classes (5, 6 and 8) and then reduce dimension to 2;
2. perform 3-class classification based on the generated 2-dimensional data.

You may want to use eigdec.m and pca.m in Netlab toolbox (Download [Netlab toolbox](https://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/research/groups/ncrg/resources/netlab). Alternative link: [Matlab FileExchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/2654-netlab)).
