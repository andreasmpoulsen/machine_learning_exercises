# Exercise - Multilayer Perceptrons

Develop an MLP for the MNIST database by using the dimension-reduced data from your work on Exercises 2 and 3. You can download the LDA projected data [here](../Datasets/mnist_lda). Furthermore, you can use 10-, 20- and 30-dimensional data generated by PCA and compare their performance (at the same time, try various MLP architectures).

Functions for MLP in the [Netlab toolbox](https://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/research/groups/ncrg/resources/netlab) include mlp.m, mlptrain.m and mlpfwd.m.
